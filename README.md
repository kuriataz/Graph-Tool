# Graph-Tool

Authors: Ryszard Chere≈∫niak, Zofia Kuriata

1. Rules:

   1. Graphs are undirected and unweighted.
   2. Vertices are distinguished by id; ids are positive natural Ints.
   3. The structure is represented by adjacency lists.
   4. Adjacency list of the vertex is its field.
   5. Adjacency list is a list of neighbours' ids.
   6. Graph can be read from file or can be created.

2. Format of the input file:

   5
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   4 5

   First line: number of vertices
   Next lines: pairs of adjacent vertices.

3. Tools:

   1. Finding connected components.
   2. Finding diamaters of the components.
   3. Min / Max degree.
   4. Statistics of deegres.
   5. Statistics of distances between vertices.
   6. Clustering coefficients (local and global).

4. Usage:
